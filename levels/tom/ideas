* Wiz starts off standing on the only collectible in the level, and has to fall off it into an awkward position
* Jailbreak - one character is blocked until another can free them - both needed for end
* Wiz forced to push block on first move which makes rest of level very hard!
* Wiz forced to make an early decision re. which block to push / break on first move - only possible one way
* Terse level filled with lots of blocks, breakables and ladders. Single collectable at top - meet half-way by bringing it down
* Wiz and blob start next to each other at top-middle ona 2x1 X platform
** First variant - each has to fall off a different way
** Second variant - each has to fall off the same way, though which is not immediately obvious
* Blob starts on top of wiz, first move *has* to be to switch to blob and move to the side
* Pit which has a collectable at the bottom - wiz has another collectiable to get first, and hard to do without pushing a block into the pit and blocking the other one!
